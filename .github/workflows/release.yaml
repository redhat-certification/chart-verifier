name: create release on new tags

# This workflow is triggered by new version tags (e.g. "1.12.2" without leading "v") on the main
# branch.
#
# Tagging should be automatic after each merged PR release (see the build.yaml workflow).
# Alternatively, this workflow can be triggered by manually creating a tag on the main branch with
# the aforementioned format. Note that the tests are *not* run by this workflow, and that you
# should therefore apply caution before manually tagging the main branch in order to trigger it.
#
# This workflow contains a check that the tag matches the version set in
# ./pkg/chartverifier/version/version_info.json.
#
# In order to recreate a GitHub release and rebuild its associated assets, first the tag needs to
# be manually deleted (e.g `git tag --delete 1.12.2 && git push --delete origin 1.12.2`). The
# GitHub release that was created for this tag automatically turns into a "Draft" release and will
# need to be manually cleaned up, though it doesn't constitute a blocker for this workflow to run.
# Finally, as mentioned above, create a new tag (e.g. `git tag 1.12.2 && git push --tags`) to
# recreate the release.
#
# This workflow builds all release assets (the tarball and the container images), creates the
# Github release and attaches the tarball to it.
